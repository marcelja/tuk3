\begin{abstract}
The taxi business is an extremely competitive market. Private ridesharing companies such as Uber or Lynx have grown tremendously in the last decade. In order to survive as a traditional taxi company, the drivers have to increase their profit even further. Therefore, we created an application, that analysis taxi data recorded over one day in the city of Shenzhen. We examine which taxis were the most profitable ones by calculating the distances and times driven with a passenger. From this information, we can draw specific recommendations, where to take passengers at a certain time, so that the profit can be maximized.
